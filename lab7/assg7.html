        <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="pills-sdp" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-sdp-tab">
            <h3>Software Development Project (SDP)</h3>
            <p>The SDP is crucial for applying theoretical knowledge to build a complete, functional software solution. As a MERN stack developer, this is your playground.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Simulates a real-world development environment, teaching you version control (like Git), task management, and communication skills within a team.</li>
                <li><strong>Full-Stack Experience:</strong> It requires you to work on both the frontend and backend, connect to a database, and deploy the application, providing a holistic understanding of the entire development lifecycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> You learn to tackle a real-world problem statement, design a system architecture, and implement features from scratch, which is a core skill for any software engineer.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <!-- EDI Content -->
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-edi" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-edi-tab">
            <h3>Engineering Design and Innovation (EDI)</h3>
            <p>EDI projects focus on the creative and inventive aspects of engineering, pushing you to think outside the box and build tangible prototypes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Innovation and Creativity:</strong> Challenges you to come up with novel solutions to existing problems, fostering an entrepreneurial mindset.</li>
                <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Moves beyond just code to hardware or integrated systems. You learn to build and test physical or electro-mechanical prototypes, bridging the gap between software and the real world.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Skills:</strong> Often involves collaboration with students from other engineering branches, providing exposure to different domains and work styles.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <!-- DT Content -->
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-dt" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-dt-tab">
            <h3>Design Thinking (DT)</h3>
            <p>Design Thinking is a human-centric approach to innovation. It's less about the final code and more about understanding the user for whom you are building.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Empathy:</strong> Teaches you to put the user first by conducting research, creating user personas, and understanding pain points. This is invaluable for creating products that people love to use.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Process:</strong> Emphasizes a cycle of ideation, prototyping, and testing. It helps in failing fast and learning quickly, reducing the risk of building the wrong product.</li>
                <li><strong>Structured Problem-Solving:</strong> Provides a framework (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test) to tackle complex, ill-defined problems systematically.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <!-- Course Projects Content -->
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-projects" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-projects-tab">
            <h3>Course Projects</h3>
            <p>Course-specific projects are fundamental for cementing the theoretical concepts learned in lectures and labs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concept Reinforcement:</strong> Applying concepts from subjects like Data Structures, DBMS, or Operating Systems to a small-scale project helps solidify your understanding far better than theory alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Practical Application:</strong> Provides hands-on experience with specific algorithms, technologies, or patterns discussed in a course (e.g., implementing a sorting visualizer for an algorithms course).</li>
                <li><strong>Building Blocks:</strong> These smaller projects serve as building blocks, giving you the confidence and foundational skills needed to tackle larger projects like SDP.</li>
            </ul>
